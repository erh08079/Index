<h1>The Super Mario Maker</h1> 
<h1>Super Level-Making Guide</h1>
<h2>Welcome!</h2>
<img src="controller.png" alt="Controller">
<p><b>Are you tired of making crummy levels in <i>Super Mario Maker</i>?</b></p> 
<p><b>Are you ready to take your game up to the next level?</b></p>
<p><i>Well you've come to the right place!</i></p>
</div>
<p class='special'>
Let's start with<b> the basics!</b>
<p>So you want to create a level? Well, luckily for you, <i>Super Mario Maker</i> is a simple and intuitive game that allows you to create the levels that you’ve always wanted in a Mario game, featuring <i>four</i> different styles from Mario history, <i>six</i> different themes, and <i>a ton</i> of enemies, hazards, and platforms to choose from.</p>
<p>First you need to pick a <b>style</b> for your level. As I mentioned before, there are 4 to choose from: the original <i>Super Marios Bros.</i>, <i>Super Mario Bros. 3</i>, <i>Super Mario World</i>, and <i>New Super Mario Bros. U</i>. </p>
<p>It is important to think carefully about which style you want, since there are exclusive items and mechanics for each one. If you aren’t careful, you could add an element that, due to the style you chose, allows the player to bypass a certain part of your level. This is known as “breaking” the level, and it’s a phrase that is best understood through trial and error rather than text.</p> 
<p>However, I’ve provided a little table that summarizes the differences between styles to hopefully help prevent a few of those errors. This is by no means an all-inclusive list, but it should help you decide which style is best for your level.</p>

<p>Now that you've chosen a style for your level, it's time to choose the <b>theme</b> for it!</p>
<p>There are 6 different types of themes in <i>Super Mario Maker</i>. Themes allow you to change the <i>type</i> of level you're creating, and affect the music and overall look and mechanics of your level.</p> 
<p>With all 6 themes available for all 4 level styles, the amount of choice is quite staggering. Here's a quick look at all of the themes in each style:     
<p><a HREF="grass.html">Grassland</a></p>
<p><a HREF="underwater.html">Underwater</a></p>
<p><a HREF="airship.html">Airship</a></p>
<p><a HREF="ghost.html">Ghost House</a></p>
<p><a HREF="underground.html">Underground</a></p>
<p><a HREF="castle.html">Castle</a></p>
<p>It is important to note that each theme has different hazards and items to work with as well.</p>

<p><b>Last Notes</b></p>
<p>These tips barely scratch the surface of all <i>Super Mario Maker</i> has to offer. Now I leave you to create your own levels, but not before a few final tips!</p>
</div>
<ol>
	<li><b>Play through each of your levels multiple times before uploading them-</b> Some errors will only present themselves occasionally, and can be missed on your first play test. Make sure you don't upload a level with a bug that makes it unbeatable!</li>
	<li><b>Don't be afraid to break the mold-</b> There are no rules in <i>Super Mario Maker</i>, so don't limit yourself!</li>
	<li><b>Remember that hard levels are fine, but cheap levels are not-</b> Make a level that you would want to play! Contrary to popular belief, your goal is <i>not</i> to kill the player as many times as possible.</li>
